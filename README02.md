## Implementation

The starter project given by Udacity [link](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git) or download original files directly by clicking [here](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1/archive/master.zip) There are 4 folders (CSS = 1 file, DATA = 1 file, IMG = 10 files JS = 3 files) a CODEOWNERS, two HTML and two README files.

I started by reading README file and its (Restaurant Reviews project rubric) link to understand how to approach to this project.

This project required changes/implementations in pretty much all files apart from IMG folder and CODEOWNERS file, creation of two .js files in order to make it functional to rubric requierments (responsiveness, accessibility, offline availability)



## App installation

Go to: https://github.com/luisbull/udacity-restaurant-review-app.git
  - Click on: Clone or Download.  (green color tab)
  - Download Zip file.
There are different ways to run the app through a server.  The following are the 2 different ways I used:
  - In TERMINAL (Mac system) or in COMMAND in (Windows system). Go inside the folder where you have unzipped the file and follow the instructions for the section (What do I do from here) in README.md file located in this folder.
  - In your code editor, open the project folder, then you can use "live server" (extension that probably need to be installed depending on your code editor software.  I used Virtual Studio Code for this project. Virtual Studio Code uses port 5500, therefore before you need to change the port in dbhelpre.js file (line 11) instead of 8000 you put 5500 and save the file. Finally you can launch the server by clicking in the "Go Live" link located in the small banner at the bottom of your Virtual Studio Code.
